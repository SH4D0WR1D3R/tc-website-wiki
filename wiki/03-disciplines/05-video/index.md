Information about a Video Designer's responsibilities throughout the show process can be found on the
[Shows](/wiki/warwick-drama/shows) pages.

Video is a rarely used department in shows, but you may want to use it for projections, recording, or livestreaming. 
Recording and livestreaming are more commonly used during hires (for example, at WSAF, the XMAS Lights Switch On, or the NULSCC).
