# General Meetings, AGMs and Elections

## Annual General Meetings (AGMs)

An Annual General Meeting is the main General Meeting which is called towards the end of Term 2 each year. During this
meeting:

1. The Exec will present a report on the year's activities, including our shows, hires, trainings, socials
   and finance. They will also discuss any notable achievements and changes that took place.
2. The society will discuss and vote on motions (changes to the [Constitution](./03-constitution.md)) that they believe
   would lead to the improvement of the society.
3. Following presentations from each candidate, the society will vote on the new Exec for the upcoming year.
