# Internal Transfers

Internal transfers are used to transfer money within Warwick SU society accounts - if you work with Tech Crew on an
event, you will likely be asked to submit an **Internal Transfer Form** for payment.

This is an
[online form](https://www.warwicksu.com/societies-sports/exec-resources/finance/financeforms/internaltransfer/) on the
SU's website, which is processed by the societies coordinators and the finance department monthly.

## Submitting an Internal Transfer Form

   * Your account details can be obtained using the instructions below.
   * Tech Crew's account details can be found on the bottom of your invoice, or obtained by emailing

Society account numbers can be found on the [SU Finance Portal](https://finance.warwicksu.com/students/login.aspx),
which is linked at the bottom of the Warwick SU website under **Club & Society Finance Tools**.

If you don't have your society/sports club username and password, this can be requested from the SU
reception/finance office or by emailing studentactivities@warwicksu.com.

On this page, you can find the following for each account:
* **Account Number**: the number on the account. These typically start with `1` for income accounts and `4` for
  outcome accounts.
* **Cost Code:** your society/sports club cost code
* **Department:** `X01` for a society or sports club
* **Account Name:** the name of the account
* **Total:** the value of the account. Note that these are 'inverted' (negative for income, or positive for outcome)

When submitting an Internal Transfer Form, you will need to provide the account number, cost code and department.
